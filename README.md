Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering refers to a branch of Computer Science that focuses on the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
From my understanding, traditional programming involves writing specific codes that instruct the computer on what to do. The Software Development Life Cycle is a cost-effective and time-efficient process which is used by software development teams to build high-quality software. 

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
 1. Plan- this phase involves analysing the cost of the project at hand, the resources avaiable/required for it and the benefits that will arise from it.
 2. Design- this is where the team makes choices on the best technologies to use ofr the project.
 3. Implement- here, the plans and choices made earlier are put into place.
 4. Test- the testing phase involves checking for errors and ensuring that the goals have been met.
 5. Deploy- deployment involves releasing the product in phases or fully to the public to observe how it will work in the real consumer environment.
 6. Maintain- finally, the team manages any changes, fixes errors(bugs) and works to resolve any issues that may arise.
    
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile models promote shorter development life cycles and has a feedback loop that prioritizes customer feedback and changes that need to be made with regards to it. Waterfall models are where the traditional and logical sequence of steps are followed. From this definitions, it is clear that agile models are feedback-based while the waterfall models only provide feedback once the final stage of the process is completed. Agile is best to employ when developing software that is made for an industry that is constanlty changing. This way, adjustments can be made quicker when applying agile models. If the goals are clear and certain requirements have to be met, waterfall models are best to use.  

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering refers to the process of identifying, analyzing, specifying, validating and managing the needs of the stakeholders of a software system. The requirements engineering process has the following stages:
1. Feasibility- this stage involves analysis of the technical, operational and economic environment to ensure that they favor the development of the project.
2. Requirements elicitation- this is where information about the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system are gathered. 
3. Requirements specification- the many requirements gathered are now narrowed down to a few that truly explain the requirements of the software system.
4. Requirements verification and validation- this involves checking that the requirements for a software system are complete, consistent, and accurate and that they meet the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.
5. Requirements management- requirements management is where the requirements are managed through analyzing, documenting, tracking and  prioritizing.

   The requirements engineering process is important as it ensures that the software system created meets all the needs of the stakeholders.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity refers to the process of creating software modules. A module is a software component that has been created from a divided software. When specific changes are required, developers can focus on specific modules instead of having to go through the whole system, making maintenance easy. Modularity also enhances scalability by breaking down software components into smaller modules that can be reused.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
  1. Unit testing- This is the first level of testing where individual units or components of the software are tested. 

  2. Integration testing- this is the second level where the testers, not developers, conduct the testing. Here, individual software components are combined and tested as a group.

  3. System testing- here, all components are tested together to ensure that the specific requirements are met.

  4. Acceptance testing- this is the last level where a decision is made whether the software should be made accessible to the public.

  Software testing uncovers problems in the software before it is released to the public. This way, when it is released, customers are highly satisfied as the software meets their requirements.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.


Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?


Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?


What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
